                    <p>
                        2. I tried out three relaxing features offered by the site
                    <p>(1) Music therapy, the site offers a 20-minute meditation music, I tried to relax to the music
                        and it was really effective.</p>
                    <p>(2) Emotional talk, users can send messages to the website about various things they encounter
                        in their daily lives, similar to telling a story about their troubles to a tree hole, this
                        feature of the website is a very creative interaction design.</p>
                    <p> (3) Encouraging relaxation, the user can adjust the colour of this page and by clicking anywhere
                        on the site words of encouragement and enthusiasm will appear to make the user feel positively
                        influenced.</p>

                    <p>
                        When I first opened the site I was impressed by the choice of page styles it offers. The site
                        offers a choice of four web design styles, allowing users to choose their own style of web page
                        to browse.

                    <p>
                        I spent the most time experiencing this website called a space to feel busy page, which could
                        change the overall colour to my liking, and mouse clicks anywhere on the page would bring up
                        words of encouragement, such as, come on, you can do it. I think the functionality and
                        presentation of the page is very interesting and really relaxes the user mentally.

                    <p>
                        In the two minutes I spent on this site, I changed the background style of the pages most often
                        to experience the digital spa interaction in different styles of backgrounds, different
                        backgrounds not only bring a new relaxing experience, each background also has its own
                        interactive features, for example, the beam background of the page can follow the mouse to
                        increment, each background of the mouse will be replaced by a different icon, these interactive
                        experiences are very interesting.

                        As an expectation of how the site would be structured to make the digital spa experience better
                        for the user, the site's diverse design and three immersive interactive experiences allowed me
                        to experience an effective and fun digital spa.

                    <p>
                        The main function of the website is to allow the user to experience a spiritual release and
                        digital spa, therefore there are many functional buttons on the homepage and some of them have
                        additional links, audio videos or images. This allows the user to experience the digital spa in
                        a variety of ways.

                        <strong> 7.What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often
                            you are intended to interact with the experience?</strong>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I spend around 20 seconds interacting with the site in a single session, and I often skim
                        through the layout of the pages quickly, staying longer when I come across a page that interests
                        me.

                    <p>
                        I think the design of the site is a reference to the spa menu and when entering the site, the
                        home page is a selection of digital spas and a rough introduction to them. The variety of
                        digital spa services on the site also references relaxation treatments that are very popular on
                        the internet, such as sound meditation relaxation which references ASMR, and sending letters to
                        the site which references email. I think a service themed website with a diverse range of
                        options is an effective way to meet the needs of our clients.

                    <p>
                        I think the interaction design of the site is very varied and the style of the interface is very
                        creative, but this is a digital spa themed site that aims to relax the user and make them
                        experience positive emotions, so I think there are some issues with the design elements of the
                        interface, the site could include some images or icons that contain a calming, comforting feel
                        and the choice of shades could be towards grey, (bright colours are difficult to bring about a
                        calming effect on the user).

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The basic composition of the website is composed of a menu and some jump links, which makes the
                        design of the interface look relatively single, I think these hyperlinks can be designed with
                        some icons to fill the interface gap of the webpage, and the other is that the text layout of
                        the webpage can be changed according to the design style of the interface, I noticed that the
                        text layout of the webpage in the four styles of I noticed that the text layout of the web pages
                        did not change in any of the four styles of design, which made the text look rather confusing
                        when combined with the layout of some other styles of interface. Addressing this issue would
                        make the typography of the website clearer and more comfortable for users to use.

                    <p>
                        What I like most about the website is its multiplicity of interactivity and the choice of
                        different interface styles. The variety of styles and the variety of services available attracts
                        users to explore the site.
